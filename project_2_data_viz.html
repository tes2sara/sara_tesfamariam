                            <h1>Supermarket Sales Vizualization.</h1>
                        </div>
                        <div class="des-container">
                            <p>My aim for this project is to analyze the Supermarket 
                                Sales Dataset to create a dashboard communicating some 
                                of the supermarket's key performance indicators. The 
                                interactive dashboard will display weekly key performance 
                                indicators to get valuable insights into the key sales and 
                                related figures, product types sold to track inventory 
                                turnover, customer satisfaction score, and segmentation 
                                of customers by membership, gender and payment method.
                            </p>

                            <p>My initial adjustment is to change the date and time feature 
                                format to DateTime format and add a week number feature to 
                                make the weekly analysis straightforward. The subsequent 
                                step I took was to understand how many categories there 
                                are in the dataset.</p>

                                <div class="image">
                                <img src="project_2_data_viz_image/category.png" alt="categories in the dataset" title="Categories in the dataset" class="responsive-image">
                                </div>
                            <p>After looking at the categories, I inserted a radio item 
                                that allows the user to choose whether the dashboard displays 
                                the combined branch results or the results of the individual 
                                branches separately.  </p>

                                <div class="image">
                                    <img src="project_2_data_viz_image/compare.png" alt="RadioItems" title="RadioItems" class="responsive-image">
                                    </div>
                            <p>Based on the chosen display the dashboard shows the reporting 
                                period, total sales, gross profit, gross profit percentage, 
                                cost of goods and average customer rating.</p>

                                <div class="image">
                                    <img src="project_2_data_viz_image/KPI.png" alt="KPI" title="KPI" class="responsive-image">
                                    </div>

                            <p>Moreover, the dashboard shows the weekly and daily sales trends 
                                for the chosen view. This allows users to get a snapshot of sales performance 
                                for a particular week or day of the week.</p>

                                <div class="image">
                                    <img src="project_2_data_viz_image/Sales.png" alt="Sales" title="Sales" class="responsive-image">
                                    </div>
                            <p>The dashboard also shows sales by product type to show 
                                the sales generated from the different product 
                                categories. Showing the contribution of products 
                                to the sales figure could help to curate products to 
                                match customers' demands. </p>

                                <div class="image">
                                    <img src="project_2_data_viz_image/Product_sales.png" alt="Product Sales" title="Product Sales" class="responsive-image">
                                    </div>

                            <p>Finally, to see the effect of members on sales, I have used 
                                the members and normal categories to drill further into 
                                the total payment they made, what kind of payment type 
                                they used, and their gender type.</p>

                                <div class="image">
