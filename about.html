                                <p>I am an enthusiastic and dedicated multidisciplinary professional with a strong foundation in Accounting, finance, and Applied Data Science.
                                    My unique educational background enables me to bring a data-driven approach to financial analysis, forecasting, risk management
                                    and strategic decision-making.  
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I hold a Bachelor's degree in Accounting and Finance from London Metropolitan University, where
                                    I developed a comprehensive understanding of financial principles, financial reporting,
                                    and investment analysis.

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Recently, I furthered my education by earning a degree in Applied Data Science from Noroff 
                                    University College, where I learned to optimize the power of data using statistical analysis, machine learning, and
                                    visualizing the findings using data visualization tools for informed decision-making.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The diagram below shows the subjects I learned during my study.                             
                                </p>

                                    </div>

                                <p>During my studies, I have performed projects demonstrating data science skills to create
                                    descriptive and predictive models to enhance decision-making. I have included some of 
                                    these projects on the project page of my portfolio website.
                                </p>

                                <p>I aim to leverage my combined accounting, finance, and data science expertise to 
                                    drive financial analysis and decision-making. I am detail-oriented and analytical, with a 
                                    solid commitment to continuous learning. My ability to bridge the gap between finance and technology
                                    allows me to offer unique perspectives and solutions to financial challenges. I am eager to connect
                                    with professionals interested in the intersection of finance and data science.
